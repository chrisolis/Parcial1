        <h2> TIMELINE </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p> <span> Feb 24, 1995 </span> Steven Paul Jobs was born in San Francisco, California, to students Abdul Fattah Jandali and Joanne Carole Schieble who were unmarried at the time and gave him up for adoption. He was taken in by a working class couple, Paul and Clara Jobs, and grew up with them in Mountain View, California.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> <span> 1976 </span> Jobs pre-sold 50 of the as-yet unmade computers to a local store and managed to buy the components on credit solely on the strength of the order, enabling them to build the Apple I without any funding at all. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> <span> 1985 </span> Jobs was fired from Apple and immediately founded another computer company, NeXT. Its machines were not a commercial success but some of the technology was later used by Apple when Jobs eventually returned there. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> <span> Oct 5, 2011 </span> Steve Jobs dies. </p>
